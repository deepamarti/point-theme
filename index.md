## Hello, I'm Deepa!

I'm a second-year Computer Science major at the University of California, Davis in the University Honors Program. I'm fascinated by the interestion of computer science and design, as well as how technology can be used to connect people.

Currently, I'm interning at [CloudKnox Security](https://cloudknox.io/) on the Engineering team.

### Some fun facts 
- I love to draw and even sell some of my drawings as stickers on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/DeepasDesigns)!   
- In high school, I was on an all-girls robotics team in which I wrote code for the robot and also produced and narrated our Chairman's Award videos. You can check out the videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R8_bYiux9E) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X3hc3d85Og).  
- I love cruciferous vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, brussel sprouts). 😍
