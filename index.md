Title: Hi, I'm Deepa

## Hello, I'm Deepa!

I'm a third-year Computer Science major at the University of California, Davis in the University Honors Program. I'm fascinated by the intersection of computer science and design, as well as how technology can be used to connect people. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I'm currently a Technology Intern at Wells Fargo.

### Some fun facts!
- In high school, I was on an all-girls robotics team in which I wrote code for the robot and also produced and narrated our Chairman's Award videos. You can check out the videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R8_bYiux9E) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X3hc3d85Og).  
- I love to run and am currently training for my second half-marathon.
